# Duolingo-Stock-MonteCarlo-Simulations

This repository contains Python code for simulating Duolingo's stock price using the Monte Carlo method.

**Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to provide a simulation-based approach to forecast Duolingo's stock price. By employing the Monte Carlo method, we can generate multiple potential scenarios and analyze the potential range of outcomes.

**How It Works**

The simulations are based on Duolingo's stock price historical data. The Monte Carlo method involves randomly generating future price movements based on statistical properties of the historical data. By running multiple simulations, we can obtain a distribution of potential stock prices.

**Disclaimer**

Please note that the simulations provided in this repository are for educational and informational purposes only. They should not be considered as financial advice or an accurate prediction of stock prices. Always conduct thorough research and consult with a financial professional before making investment decisions.

I hope you find this project useful and insightful. Happy simulating!
